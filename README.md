## Contributing

### Setup

1. [Install `npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm): Node's package manager
2. [Install `gulp`](https://gulpjs.com/): a build tool
3. Install dependencies: from the root of this repo `$ npm install`
4. Run the local server: `$ gulp watch`
5. Edit files! Gulp will watch for changes, build the differences and reload the browser

### Content

`html` files are split by section in the `html/` folder, and then built into the `index.html` file.

After editing content, if `gulp watch` was running, you're good ; otherwise, run `gulp build` to apply your changes.
### Data
